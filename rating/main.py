    """ Main is an abstract base class for running the chess rating
    application.  There should be subclasses for the USCF, Lichess,
    chess.com, and FIDE rating platforms.

    This class uses the Template design pattern:
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_method_pattern.
    It defines the outline of the operation but relies on subclasses
    to provide necessary implementations of the details of their
    particular platform.

    It also provides the implementation of functions common to all
    subclasses, like the HTTP "get" method.

        Fetches and processes rating information from the specified rating platform.

        This method performs the following steps:
        
        1. Constructs the URL for fetching rating data using the `get_url` method, 
        which must be implemented by each subclass.
        
        2. Retrieves the content from the URL using the `get` method. If an error 
        occurs, the method prints an error message and returns early.
        
        3. Parses the retrieved content using the `parse_content` method, which 
        processes the HTML or JSON data according to the platformâ€™s format. 
        The output is expected to be a list of strings representing rating 
        information or None if an error occurs.
        
        4. If parsing is successful, prints the extracted rating(s) to the console.
